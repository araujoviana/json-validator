# JSON Validator

A lightweight, web-based utility for validating JSON syntax and structure, leveraging modern technologies such as Svelte, TypeScript, and Vite to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience. The interface is styled with Bulma CSS, and the project is optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages.

*Please* note that while this tool is designed to identify common errors, it is not a substitute for rigorous testing or validation, and its results should be verified accordingly. This project is primarily intended as a proof-of-concept and educational exercise, rather than a production-ready solution.
